#Game control : press 'g' key to advance by a day in game, for crops to be ready for harvest. 



Bug report*

1 Inventory will get empty upon moving between game scene and nft minter scene. 
Will not be affected when moving between other game scenes. 

2 Crystal and carrot count (in inventorymanager script) referenced variable had some problem, they sometime addsup when picking other items, So had to remove it from addattribute script, so there is no condition or constraints on minting nft(you can mint any amount of test nft) . Will fix it after hackathon.
